🔐 Task 1 – Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
This task is part of my Cybersecurity Internship at Skillcrafft Technology.

📝 Task Description
Create a program that performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The user inputs a message and a shift value. The program then returns the encrypted message and decrypts it back to the original.

🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption method where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
Example:

Original: Default

Shift: +3

Encrypted: KLMHBSA

🧾 Features

Accepts user input for message and shift value

Encrypts alphabetic characters (uppercase and lowercase)

Preserves spaces and special characters

Decrypts the message by reversing the shift

💻 Technologies Used

Python 3

ASCII manipulation

Basic string operations

🚀 How to Run
Use any Python environment or online compiler and run the file caesar_cipher.py.

📂 Files Included

SCT_CS_1.py – Main script for Caesar Cipher logic
